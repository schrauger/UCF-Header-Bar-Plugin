Add the UCF Header bar into any WordPress website. Recommended for use on all UCF WordPress websites.

== Description ==

The UCF Header Bar plugin allows the simple inclusion of the [UCF Header bar](https://universityheader.ucf.edu/) into your UCF WordPress website using enqueue_script.  The UCF University Header is a cohesive marketing and branding tool for the entire university. It provides consistent navigational elements and a universal search feature with search suggestions.

The University Header has a responsive option and will adapt to various screen sizes as necessary. Responsiveness follows Twitter Bootstrap's breakpoint standards.

== Installation ==

Installation is quick and easy with only one setting.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/ucf-header-bar` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->UCF Header Bar screen to configure the plugin if your site's max-width is larger than 1200px.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
